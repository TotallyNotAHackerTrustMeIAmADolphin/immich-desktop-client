</p>

The **Immich Desktop Client** is an open-source application designed to integrate seamlessly with the Immich self-hosted
media management platform. This client simplifies the process of uploading and managing media files directly from your
desktop to your Immich server.

## Features

- **Automated Media Upload**: Scans specified directories for media files and uploads new or modified files to your
  Immich server
- **Uploads to Album**: Automatically creates an album and puts all the images in it
- **Local Upload Record**: Tracks uploaded files in a local SQLite database with SHA-1 hashes to avoid duplicate uploads
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures data integrity with SHA-1 checksum verification during uploads
- **Replace & Delete (opt-in)**: Re-uploads edited files and moves the old copy to the Immich trash; can also trash
  uploads when you delete the local file. It never force-deletes and only touches files this client uploaded itself
- **Tray, Settings & Autostart**: Settings window, tray menu, single instance and start with Windows
- **Cross-Platform**: _should_ be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux (only tested on Windows 11)

## Demo

<a href="https://youtu.be/lpWbLVVhZjM" target="_blank">Here is a short video demonstrating the use of Immich-Desktop-Client!</a>

## Prerequisites

- Immich server instance
- API key for your Immich server (accessible from the Immich web interface)

## Usage

### Installation

#### Windows

1. Install with the Installer executable
2. modify the config file in the .immich-desktop-client folder in your home directory
3. enjoy

#### Other Platforms

theoretically the python script is cross platform, therefore it should be executable on macOS and Linux

## Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> The config file __MUST__ be in the `.immich-desktop-client` folder in your home directory!

### Configuration Fields

#### `api`

- **`key`**: Your Immich API key. This is required to authenticate with the Immich server.
- **`url`**: The base URL of your Immich server API endpoint. _Ensure the URL ends with `/api` and does not have a
  trailing slash._
- **`album`**: (Optional) The name of the album where media files will be uploaded.
- **`album_by_year`**: (Optional, default `false`) Upload into one album per year, named `<album> <year>`.

#### `watchdog`

- **`directories`**: A list of directories the client will monitor for media files. Files in these directories will be
  automatically uploaded to the Immich server.
- **`recursive`**: (Optional, default `true`) Also watch sub-folders.

#### `delete`

Optional, everything defaults to `false`. Deleting only ever moves this client's own uploads to the Immich trash
(restorable there); files that already existed on the server are never touched.

- **`live`**: Trash the upload when you delete the local file while the app is running.
- **`catch_up`**: At startup, trash uploads whose local file is gone. Folders that cannot be reached (unplugged drive)
  are skipped.

#### Server requirements

Immich **3.0.0 or newer**. Older or unreadable server versions are refused.

### Example Configuration

Below is an example `config.yaml` file:

````yaml
api:
  key: apikey12345
  url: https://immich.domain.test/api
  album: Oida
watchdog:
  directories:
    - C:\Users\test\Images and Videos\
    - C:\Users\test\Screenshots\

````

## Build it yourself

1. run ``pyinstaller -n immich-dsektop-client -F src/main.py``
2. run ``resources\installer-script.iss`` with Inno Setup

See [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for the tests and checks that gate a release.

## Credits

Replace, delete, tray, autostart, `album_by_year`, `recursive` and retry behaviour were first built in
[GuidoJeuken-6512's fork](https://github.com/GuidoJeuken-6512/immich-desktop-client) and are re-implemented here.
Linux fixes by [tkalfaoglu](https://github.com/tkalfaoglu/immich-desktop-client) informed the cross-platform work.

## Roadmap

- Put files from different folders in different albums
